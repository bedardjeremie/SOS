SOS

To set up the environment:
1. In your SOS folder, run command: pip install virtualenv
2. run command: pip install virtualenvwrapper-win
3. run command: mkvirtualenv sos
4. Still in your SOS folder, run command: setprojectdir
5. run command: pip install flask

Good job!

If you ever want to leave the development environment, run command: deactivate
If you want to start to boot the development environment again, run command: workon <name of environment> 
(i.e: workon sos)
